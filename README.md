a. The submission can be installed and ran by downloading the main.go file and using go run. 

b. The programming language chosen was Go as this was the language designated by my supervisor 
as working with Go would directly prepare me for future work.

c. Developers are expected to use the library similarly to that mentioned in part a, after which
they can simply enter in an IMEI and have it parsed or know what property is the reason for its
invalidity.

d. I assumed the assignment wanted a program in which input was read in through the terminal in order
to keep the flow of input to response straightforward. 

e. I believe the program's efficiency at runtime could be improved by combining the parse and validate 
functions into one. Furthermore, the program's error handling is not completely optimal.
