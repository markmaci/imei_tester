# imei_tester
a. The submission can be installed and ran by downloading the main.go and testdata.txt files and using go run. 

b. The programming language chosen was Go as this was the language designated by my supervisor 
as working with Go would directly prepare me for future work.

c. Developers can use the library similarly to that mentioned in part a or using their own data file.

d. I assumed that the data file would have each imei seperated by some delimiter. 

e. I believe the program's efficiency at runtime could be improved by combining the parse and validate 
functions into one. Furthermore, the program's error handling is not completely optimal.
